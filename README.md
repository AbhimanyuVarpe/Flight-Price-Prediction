# Flight-Price-Prediction

Anyone who has booked a flight ticket knows how unexpectedly the prices vary. The cheapest available ticket on a given flight gets more and less expensive over time.
This usually happens as an attempt to maximize revenue based on -
1. Time of purchase patterns (making sure last-minute purchases are expensive)
2. Keeping the flight as full as they want it (raising prices on a flight that is filling up in order to reduce sales and hold back inventory for those expensive last-minute expensive purchases)

So, I have to work on a project where I collect data on flight fares with other features and work to make a model to predict the fares of flights.
